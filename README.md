## Problem Statement
Build multiple classification models for intrusion detection
and deploy an interactive Streamlit web application.

---

## Dataset Description
NSL-KDD cybersecurity dataset used for intrusion detection.
Contains network traffic features used to classify
normal vs attack connections.

---

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Metrics used:
Accuracy, AUC Score, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, MCC.

---

## Observations
- Random Forest and XGBoost gave highest performance.
- Logistic Regression provided stable baseline.
- Naive Bayes performed slightly lower due to
  independence assumptions.
